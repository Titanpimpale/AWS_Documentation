How to host various applications on AWS EC2 ( Elastic compute cloud)
Here are 9 simple steps and Explanations ðŸ‘‡

1. Select Single or multiple locations: Select to deploy virtual instances (EC2 instances) in one or more geographic regions globally, enabling redundancy, low-latency access, and disaster recovery options for your applications.

2. Choose an AMI (Amazon machine image): AWS EC2 is like picking a ready-to-use computer setup from a library. It's a snapshot of an operating system and software that you can select to start your virtual server with the right tools for your project

3. Instance Size and Types: EC2 instances like different sizes of computers you can rent from AWS. Just like there are small, medium, and large clothes, there are also small, medium, and large instances. Each size has different amounts of memory and power, so you can choose the one that fits best for your apps, like picking the right clothes for different activities

4. Network access: Network access in AWS EC2 is like controlling who can visit your virtual computer. You decide which doors to open and who can knock on them, making sure only the right visitors can come in and use your online stuff.

5. Storage Range: Different options for saving data on the virtual computers you use. It's like having different sizes of digital storage boxes that you can pick based on how much stuff you need to store.

6. Give Tags: Labelling your virtual servers with custom names and descriptions. It's like putting labels on your books to easily find and organize them later in your virtual library.

7. Configure Security Groups: AWS EC2 is like setting up a digital fence around your computer. You decide who can visit and what they can do â€“ it's like controlling who can ring your doorbell and what rooms they can enter

8. Secure login information: Use strong passwords or cryptographic keys to access your virtual server. It's like having a special lock to ensure only authorized people can enter your online workspace.

9. Launch the EC2 application: Lastly Launching the EC2 application means putting your software on a virtual computer in Amazon's cloud
